The _itoa, _i64toa, and _ui64toa function convert the digits of the given value argument to a null-terminated character string and stores the result (up to 33 bytes) in string. If radix equals 10 and value is negative, the first character of the stored string is the minus sign ( – ). _itow, _i64tow, and _ui64tow are wide-character versions of _itoa, _i64toa, and _ui64toa respectively.
